# Question

The endpoint `/api/data` is handled by the controller `serveData` below.

If I send a request to `/api/data?filter=frog`, how do I get the value of the query parameter `filter`?

```js
const serveData = (req, res, next) => {
  const filterValue = ???
  // use the filterValue and send back a response
}
app.get('/api/data', serveData);
```

# Answer
Use the `||` operator when initializing `filterValue` so that if there is data in the endpoint then only get the frog, but nothing otherwise.

The question is asking how to get the value "frog" from the query parameter `filter`. You can do this using the `req.query` object:

```js
const filterValue = req.query.filter
```

As you mentioned, you can also use the `||` operator to provide a fallback if no query paramter is provided:

```js
const filterValue = req.query.filter || ''
```
